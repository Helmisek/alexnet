# AlexNet implementation

This is a simple implementation of AlexNet in PyTorch. It is based on the famous paper "ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks" by Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey E. Hinton.

## Model Description

AlexNet consists of five convolutional layers, followed by three fully connected layers. It uses ReLU as the activation function and dropout for regularization. The model is designed to process 224x224 RGB images.
